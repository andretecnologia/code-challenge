### Table Test

__9 : 2__ | __529 : 4__ | __1041 : 5__ | __32 : 0__

## Create an algorithm to solve the BDD described bellow:

**Given**

```9```

**When** I count the greatest number of zeros rounded by one into the Binary representation of the number

```1001```

**Then** Return

```2```

## And

**Given**

```529```

**When** I count the greatest number of zeros rounded by one into the Binary representation of the number

```1000010001```

**Then** Return

```4```

## And

**Given**

```1041```

**When** I count the greatest number of zeros rounded by one into the Binary representation of the number

```10000010001```

**Then** Return

```5```


## And

**Given**

```32```

**When** I count the greatest number of zeros rounded by one into the Binary representation of the number

```100000```

**Then** Return

```0```
